#IEEE Linux Workshop

We will be holding Linux workshops for students who wish to learn how to use the operating system and how to take advantage of its functionality.
We are hoping our workshops will spark interest in attendees to start gaining workplace-relevant Linux skills and utilizing Linux in their projects and project development workflows.

Check out the [lesson plans](LessonPlans.md) to see what we have planned so far.
If you have anything you want to add or change, send me a pull request!
