#IEEE Linux Workshop

We will be holding Linux workshops for IEEE members who wish to learn how to use the operating system and how to take advantage of its functionality.
We are hoping our workshops will spark interest in attendees to start gaining workplace-relevant Linux skills and utilizing Linux in their projects and project development workflows.

Checkout the [Lesson Plans](LessonPlans.md) to see what we have planned so far.
